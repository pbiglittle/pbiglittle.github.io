                    <p>If this is the first time you're reading this, I hope you like this small gift I created for your graduation. I honestly didn't know what to do for your graduation gift for the longest time, but I knew I wanted to make it special. Whenever you want to reminisce on your time in college or need a little bit of encouragement or are just bored, I hope you come back to this website. It will always be here for you, and I will continue to update it as we continue to make more memories.</p>
                    <p>The world works in funny ways. It still seems like fate that for some reason my brain recalled the face of this girl from my first MUN conference and decided to go and introduce myself again.</p>
                    <p>When we first met, I wasn't really sure if we would get along. It felt like we were on completely opposite ends of the spectrum. I was this crazy, stupid kid and you were a calm, sweet, and mature adult who made wholesome time lapses. Honestly, I really don't know how you put up with me for that first year. I always wanted to hangout with you, wouldn't shut up about a certain someone, and never knew what my limit was with alcohol. Thinking back on it now, the fact that you stuck with me through all that goes to show the type of person you are and how much you cared for me. There's a reason I consider you family, because you treated me like family. You could've said no to hanging out with me, you could've just told me to shut up, and you could've just stopped taking care of me, but you never did and I'm forever grateful. You brought out the best in me and turned me from a little boy into a man.</p>
                    <p>These past three years with you have been nothing short of incredible. We've done just about everything together and I have cherished every moment with you. What started out as just small little hangouts turned into lifelong memories. The photos were just a small glimpse into everything we've done together, but looking back on them brought me so much joy. I don't think this would have happened though if you weren't so willing to take on the things I wanted to do but you did. Small things like that are why you are so amazing and why you truly do mean the world to me.</p>
                    <p>You are my role model, my inspiration, and I always have and always will look up to you. You are always enough in my eyes and truly are the best person I’ve met in my life. I really can’t express just in words how much you mean to me and at this point in writing this tears are streaming down my eyes. You have truly changed my life and I love you so much Alyson.</p>
                    <p>Love,</p>
                    <p>Henry</p>
